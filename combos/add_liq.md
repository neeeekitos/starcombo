# Providing liquidity 

## How can I add liquidity to a pool?

To do so, you'll need to navigate to the combos page and click the :icon-plus-circle: sign to add an interaction.
From there, you'll be able to select the protocol where you want to add liquidity.

Clicking on _Add Liquidity_ will add a block to the list. You can select the tokens you wish to provide liquidity for and press "Set" when you're done.
