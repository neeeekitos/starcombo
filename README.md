# Starcombo
Starcombo is a Furocombo-like web app that allows users to do multiple invokes inside a single L2 transaction on Starknet âœ¨.

Users will be able to manipulate basic blocks that represent an interaction with a smart contract, such as the **approval** for a token, a **swap**, a **transfer**, or providing **liquidity** to a liquidity pool. It's easy enough to drag&drop these blocks to chain them in a specific order, allowing them to interact with several protocols inside a single app. 

We have already begun integrating several AMM protocols into our app such as [JediSwap](https://app.testnet.jediswap.xyz/) and [MySwap](https://www.myswap.xyz/#/), and we plan to add more protocols once they go live. With incoming protocols on Starknet such as Aave, using **flashloans** and making **complex transactions** will be much easier with Starcombo thanks to a user-friendly graphical interface.
