# Starcombo
Starcombo is a Furocombo-like web app that allows users to do multiple invokes inside a single L2 transaction on Starknet. Users will be able to manipulate basic blocks that represent an interaction with a smart contract, such as the approval for a token, a swap, a transfer, or providing liquidity to a liquidity pool. Users will be able to drag&drop these blocks to chain them in a specific order, allowing them to interact with several protocols inside a single app. We have already begun integrating several AMM protocols into our app such as JediSwap and MySwap, and we plan to add more protocols once they go live. With incoming protocols on Starknet such as Aave , using flashloans and making complex transactions will be much easier with Starcombo thanks to a user-friendly graphical interface.
