# Starcombo Introduction

## What is Starcombo?

Starcombo is a tool allowing users to build their DeFi strategy on Starknet simply by drag&drop.

When creating a __combo__, users can access multiple DeFi protocols and select which action they want to do.
Users will then need to fill in the required inputs, and Starcombo will bundle them into a _combo_, which is a single transaction
sent on the Starknet network.

## Which protocols can I use with Starcombo?

For now, only [Jediswap](https://app.testnet.jediswap.xyz/) and [Myswap](https://www.myswap.xyz/) are supported.
